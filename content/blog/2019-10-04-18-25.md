There was a howling wind all night, with lightening hammering down on the hills around Lefkas. It has cut through the humidity though and makes for a lovely breezy day. 

First things first we take the lifejackets to Contract Yacht Services by Town Quay to get them serviced. Meanwhile James heads to the marina to pay Tao for fixing the scratch on the keel. 

We do some meal planning for the week ahead and stop in at a few chandleries to find a water pump - no joy. FYI if you need to stock up on cheap food in Lefkas before a passage, there is a Lidl on the far side of town. Unfortunately you need a car to get there if you are planning on carrying anything heavy back to the marina. We hired one for 24 hours from Budget cars and it cost €25. Good for tying in an adventure though. 

Our little Hyundai wizzed us up into the hills on the mainland near Monastiraki. We were trying to find an illusive waterfall with multiple pin-drops on Google Maps. The drive is beautiful, winding along the waterfront and sloping up into mountain trails, past ruins and little villages with the smell of oregano and wild mint never far. It's worth driving as high up as possible to make the most of the incredible, far- reaching views back down over the Gulf of Ambracia.

How to find the waterfall:

Absolutely no idea... but something like this... Head towards Monasteraki, turn left after the water plant. From there things get a little uncharted. We drove until the car couldn't go any further, abandoned it in the bushes (don't tell Budget), scrambled down a hill, found a cavernous overhang in the scrub which had some tools in it which could well have been from antiquity. We then climbed down a bank through some scraggy bushes and fallen trees and found ourselves in a dry river bed. From there, we walked upstream over some Jurassic park- style boulders tangled up in reams of plastic ribbon and sheeting layered into the mud.

The start of the scramble:

Eventually it opened up into a pretty magnificent hollow covered in moss and slime - the waterfall, minus the water. Both of us were totally gobsmacked that we'd managed to find it. If you can find it - do, it's totally worth getting covered in mud and grazes!

A quick stop off at Vonitsa on the way home for yes, another pitta souvlaki.

Back to the boat to embark on an industrial scale clean up and clear out of the boat while James fixes an electrical fault in the engine, the mystery sound coming from the wind turbine and fits the Jack Stays. In the midst of our sorting, the dinghy comes free and drifts into the canal behind (a little embarrassing as passing yachts wave and shout at us). Fortunately we manage to flag down a man in a speed boat who kindly tows it back, with a smile, before anyone has to jump in and swim after it.

While tidying and fixing, it is decided that we are going to become sea-faring culinary masterminds and start by making some pesto-y bruschetta and tomatoes (easiest thing in the world and requires absolutely zero cooking). It tasted pretty good though, I've gotta say.

James gets an invite from an old friend, Kev who is a yacht surveyor and ex-paratrooper, to come and have a beer at the marina so we head over and catch up with him and some of his live-aboard friends and hear his stories of jumping out of planes and having a smoke with Queen Lizzy. 

Back to Daltons for another pitta souvlaki... they are only €3 so quite frankly it would be rude not to. 

The next day we run around like mad men picking up lifejackets, going to the Port Police, getting cruising tax documents signed at the bank, trying (and failing) to find a laundrette and untangling the cruising chute on the harbour side. 

Eventually at 3pm we are ready to go, only to get grounded by a lightening storm appearing to be heading our way and not shifting until the next morning. Early night moored on the 'dodgy' end of town but at last we are all set for the voyage ahead.
