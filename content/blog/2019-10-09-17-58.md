Our first passage together. 

It was 9:45am by the time the lightening had moved far enough away so as not to pose any imminent risk. The forecast and strike records were showing that ironically the most intense lightening around the world that night was right there in Greece. Who'd have thought. We are heading for Crotone in Calabria on the south coast of Italy. The hop across is 170 nautical miles and the wind was looking good, starting out with 15 knot south easterlies, with 2-3m of swell (not so good).

By the first hour, we've hit a speed of 9 knots and are getting a little cocky at the ground covered so far.

By the second hour, I'm lying down in the cockpit trying not to have an intimate reunion with my breakfast. 

This continues into hour 12 until finally at around midnight, my face meets the bucket while trying to pull out the cruising chute that James has gallantly been untangling on deck (frustrating after yesterday's efforts!), with the boat rolling violently in the swell, for nearly 45 minutes. I'm fighting between the bucket and making sure James stays firmly on the deck, strapped into his harness. It is pitch black and to our despair we can see lightening storms jumping across the horizon from the south. The swell is unrelenting and the wind has all but disappeared, leaving us doing some grade-A-stomach-lurching rolls between waves. 

To reign in on the dramatic, James made it back to the cockpit safe and dry (and totally unfazed) and the cruising chute was up and working like a dream. We took it in turns to nap and keep watch and in the end only saw one other ship before sunrise, silently sloping away into the distance. The moonlight beamed down on the water all night, providing us with a little reassurance that those electrical storms were far, far away. 

A long night battling with the cruising chute and monitoring the forecasts finally caught up:

The wind continued to drop the next day. In the end, to our disappointment there isn't much choice but to motor for the last couple of hours. Italy appears on the horizon at about 3pm and by 6:30pm we are cruising past Crotone's offshore gas rigs and the 16th- century fortress 'Castello de Carlo V' looms on the cliff ahead. Two very animated men shouting in Italian greet us at Yacht Kroton Club, with lots hand gestures and pointing. A team of strangers who must have been individually relaxing out on their boats have now appeared on the pontoon poised at each corner of the boat, ready to catch our mooring lines. By now there are Dutch trying to speak to the Italians, trying to speak to the Germans, trying to speak to us. I'll never tire of the camaraderie between yachtsmen (I have a long way to go before I can call myself one!).

Now to the important bit. Where to get your first taste of shamelessly cheap and ridiculously delicious Italian pizza? Like this: Go straight to Young's. Don't waste any time. Don't pass Go and collect £200. Don't try and find somewhere for a drink first. Just start walking now actually.

What we thought was €12 for a slice of pizza, 2 arancini and 3 calzone ACTUALLY turned out to be THE biggest pizza I've ever held with my own two hands, plus the rest, PLUS two Peronis. More than that, it tasted like creamy, mozzarella-smothered heaven and seemed to us at least to be pretty authentic. It is a pizza in Italy after all.
