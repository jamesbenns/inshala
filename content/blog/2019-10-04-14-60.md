Part 2, Day 1:

In draws the end of a week of last minute preparations, manic goodbyes and a lot of eating (just in case). 

We are on our way.

It feels like this day has been in the pipeline for a very long time and yet it has arrived, pronto, bang on time. Here we go. Unemployed (I prefer 'funemployed'), but unabashed... and perhaps a little unprepared. 

Phil drove us to Gatwick at 2am (thank you!) to catch the last flight to Preveza of the year. Our departure date was pushed forward a couple of days due to the recent demise of Thomas Cook. No dramas though - it means we get on the road ahead of schedule. James is armed with a surfboard and ample GPS and satellite equipment and my bag is sagging with camera accessories that I don't know how to use. 

Greece on the horizon:

Arrive in Preveza. We had planned to walk from the airport to Aktio marina (2.5km according to Google) but James managed to cut his foot open while surfing last week and had to abort and take his shoes off to avoid the dreaded chafe. Somehow we flag down an old, Winnebago style camper van also en route to the marina. A lovely, sea-faring couple from Austria about to take their boat out of the water for the winter. They give us lots of cracking advise about the journey ahead, drop us right under the prop of Inshala and invite us over for a drink later. Dandy.

Barefoot maniac:

There was plenty to do to get Inshala ready to get back on the high seas. Filling up water tanks, pumping up the dinghy, tracking down the life raft from the marina, fitting the solar panels, a thorough clean etc. (once we had found a ladder to get onboard...).

While sorting out marina fees the kindly lady at reception informs us that they can get Inshala back in the water at 2pm (an hour away!), rather than tomorrow as originally planned. We run back to the boat to get everything finished.

At 3:30pm (2pm Greek- time) team of four guys turned up and had Inshala off her blocks, on the back of a trailer and in the water in less than ten minutes.  By the time the hull was wet and we had the mooring lines tied up, they had all but vanished. Greek efficiency at it's finest.

We cast off into 20 knots of north westerly wind, set the sails and head south towards Lefkas. Electrical storms and rain brewing on the horizon. We test out our new (old) jackets.

A dreamy first sail, swooping past some lonely old castles and Europe's longest beach and nip in around the corner to the Lefkas canal just in time for the 6pm bridge.

We drop anchor just off from Town Quay (it's free and safe to do so) and head straight to Dalton's for a chicken pitta souvlaki that we've been fantasising about all day. Mooch around the old town and stumble upon a chocolate crepe for the way home. 

Back to the boat for a long overdue sleep.
