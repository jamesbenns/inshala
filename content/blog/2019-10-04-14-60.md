Part 2, Day 1:

In draws the end of a week of last minute preparations, manic goodbyes and a lot of eating (just in case). 

We are on our way.

It feels like this day has been in the pipeline for a very long time and yet it has arrived, pronto, bang on time. Here we go. Unemployed (I prefer 'funemployed'), but unabashed... and perhaps a little unprepared. 

Phil drove us to Gatwick at 2am (thank you!) to catch the last flight to Preveza of the year. Our departure date was pushed forward a couple of days due to the recent demise of Thomas Cook. No dramas though - it means we get on the road ahead of schedule. James is armed with a surfboard and ample GPS and satellite equipment and my bag is sagging with camera accessories that I don't know how to use. 

Greece on the horizon:

Arrive in Preveza. We had planned to walk from the airport to the marina (2.5km according to Google) but James managed to cut his foot open last week and had to abort and take his shoes off to avoid the dreaded chafe. Somehow manage to flag down a classic, old camper van also en route to the marina. A lovely, sea-faring couple from Austria about to take their boat out of the water for the winter. They give us lots of cracking advise about the journey ahead, drop us right under the prop of Inshala and invite us over for a drink later. Dandy.

Barefoot maniac:

We fill up the water tanks, pump up the dinghy, track down the life raft and haul it onboard and fit the solar panels (once we found a ladder to get onboard).

Go to sort out payment for the boat being dry for a month and they say they can get us in the water at 2pm (an hour away!), rather than tomorrow. Back to the boat for more manic, last minute preparations and sorting. 

A team of four guys turned up and had Inshala off her blocks, on the back of a trailer and in the water in less than ten minutes.  By the time the hull was wet and we had the mooring lines tied up, they had already gone to find the next boat.

 We cast off, into 20 knots of north westerly wind, set the sails and head south towards Lefkas. Electrical storms are brewing on the horizon. We test out our new (old) jackets.

Swoop past some lonely old castles and Europe's longest beach and nip in around the corner to the Lefkas canal opening just in time for the 6pm bridge. Not another boat insight until we get to the mooring. 

Drop anchor just off from Town Quay and head straight to Dalton's for a chicken pitta souvlaki, manage to buy the country flags we need for the find and happen upon a chocolate crepe for the way home. 

Day 1 done.
